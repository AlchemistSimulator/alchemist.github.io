  text: 'Alchemist is an extensible "meta-simulator", inspired by stochastic chemistry and tailored to pervasive computing and distributed systems. It provides a flexible meta-model, on which the developers should bind their own abstractions, realizing a so-called "incarnation". Incarnations for SAPERE and Protelis are already available and integrated in the main distribution.'

  text: '
    1. Extensible: any concrete model that can be translated into the Alchemist generic meta-model can be simulated, reusing common simulator features.
    <br/>2. High performance, scales up to to thousands of nodes easily.
    <br/>3. Built on Java, runs wherever a Java 8 virtual machine runs.
    <br/>4. Click below for a comprehensive list of features'
#    <br/>4. GPL-licensed with linking exception: you can link Alchemist from your private project.
#    <br/>5. Integrated support for
#      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sapere-project.eu/">SAPERE</a>
#      and <a target="_blank" href="http://protelis.org">Protelis</a>.
#    <br/>4. Support for simulating on maps through OpenStreetMap, navigation via Graphhopper.
#    <br/>3. Built on Java, runs wherever a Java 8 virtual machine runs.
