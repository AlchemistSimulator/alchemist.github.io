  text: 'Alchemist is an extensible "meta-simulator", inspired by stochastic chemistry and tailored to pervasive computing and distributed systems. It provides a flexible meta-model, on which the developers should bind their own abstractions, realizing a so-called "incarnation". Incarnations for SAPERE and Protelis are already available and integrated in the main distribution.'

  text: '
    1. Extensible: any concrete model that can be translated into the Alchemist generic meta-model can be simulated, reusing common simulator features.
    <br/>2. High performance, scales up to to thousands of nodes easily.
    <br/>3. Built on Java, runs wherever a Java 8 virtual machine runs.
    <br/>4. Click below for a comprehensive list of features'

This example simulation executed in Alchemist shows a group of pedestrians dynamically steered in the city of London. More information about this example can be found in [this scientific paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2773424).
