      <description>How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end: while a tutorial is what a beginner needs to know, a how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate. In how-to guides, we assume some knowledge and understanding, we assume that the user already knows how to do basic things and use basic tools.</description>

      <description>Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.</description>

      <description>Reference guides are technical, austere, and to the point descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately thatâ€™s what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.</description>
